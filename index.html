               <p class="funParagraph">BEGINNING: I enrolled in a communiity college going on 10+ years ago based in
                  Burlington County, NJ. At
                  the time the school was known as BCC but is know named Rowan communiity college.
                  During my time there is when I was introduced to my primary friend group through my close friend
                  Scott.
                  Scott and I had similar interests; gaming, art, and animation. Because of our similar
                  interests in gaming we adopted what we called Monster Hunter Mondays or MHM for short. Around this
                  same
                  time is when Scott introduced me to his circle of friends he grew up with; a group that would become
                  my primary circle of friends as well. A few weeks after meeting Scott he invited me for MHM to his
                  close
                  friend's house Mark where I also met Jarrett and Jay. At the time Mark lived in Moorestown, NJ right
                  off
                  Main Street. His home was close to the Community Center and perfect walking distance to Wawa, Sakura
                  2,
                  and a few other local resturants and shops.</p>

               <p b id="testP">MIDDLE: It was an older house built in the late 1900's. The exterior of the home really
                  made the house look
                  bigger
                  than it was when compared to the inside. Not as spaciious as one would assume at first glance. When we
                  arrived it was about 7pm est and the sun had already set. The residence was mostly dark due to lights
                  being out except for in the kitchen but you could tell the home was very well decorated. Which made
                  sense after learning his mother was an interiror designer. At the time the family had a dog named
                  Cody. A
                  husky with sharp blue eyes and salt and pepper fur who was easily excited and extremely firendly.
                  We had all gathered in the kitchen conversing over random nerd/geek culture all while Cody hovered
                  around
                  me being someone new. After sometime everyone went downstairs while I continued to play with Cody for
                  a
                  bit.
                  Shortly after cody had walked off into the dark livingroom that wrapped with two entrances on either
                  side
                  leading from the kitchen. As I was getting ready to walk down to the basement another husky popped
                  into
                  the hallway wrap around and sat down.
                  For a moment I thought it was Cody but even in the dark space I could tell it was another husky that
                  had bright amber eyes and unlike Cody black fur. I called him over but as he reamined seated he
                  became uninterested and then left back into the dark living room.
                  I proceeded to the basement and we ended up playing games late into the night. </p>

               <p>END: The next day we had all gathered again at Mark's residence but much earlier in the day and the
                  sun was
                  still out. Again Cody came to greet as he had done the previous day but Mark's other husky had not
                  come to
                  greet me.
                  We all gathered in the basement and I asked Mark how long they've had Cody. Afterwards I asked him
                  what
                  about your other dog that looks like Cody and he reponds questioning "Other dog?" I describe to him
                  the
                  dog's yellow eye
                  and the dog's all black fur and Mark responds back to me. "I don't have another dog." I sat there
                  confused
                  because they clearly could tell I had seen another dog that was not there.</p>
