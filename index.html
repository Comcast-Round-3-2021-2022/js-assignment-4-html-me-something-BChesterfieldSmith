            <h1>A Ghost Story and Friendship</h1>
            <p>BEGINNING: I enrolled in a communiity college going on 10+ years ago based in Burlington County, NJ. At
               the time the school was known as BCC but is know named Rowan communiity college.
               During my time there is when I was introduced to my primary friend group through my close friend Scott.
               Scott and I had similar interests; gaming, art, and animation. Because of our similar
               interests in gaming we adopted what we called Monster Hunter Mondays or MHM for short. Around this same
               time is when Scott introduced me to his circle of friends he grew up with; a group that would become
               my primary circle of friends as well. A few weeks after meeting Scott he invited me for MHM to his close
               friend's house Mark where I also met Jarrett and Jay. At the time Mark lived in Moorestown, NJ right off
               Main Street. His home was close to the Community Center and perfect walking distance to Wawa, Sakura 2,
               and a few other local resturants and shops.</p>

         <p>MIDDLE: The home was an
            older house built in the late 1900's. The exterior of the home really made the house look bigger
            than it was when compared to the inside. Not as spaciious as one would assume at first glance. When we
            arrived it was about 7pm est and the sun had already set. The residence was mostly dark due to lights
            being out except for in the kitchen but you could tell the home was very well decorated. Which made
            sense after learning his mother was an interiror designer. At the time the family had a dog named Cody. A
            husky with sharp blue eyes and salt and pepper fur who was easily excited and extremely firendly.
            We had all gathered in the kitchen conversing over random nerd/geek culture all while Cody hovered around
            me being someone new. After sometime everyone went downstairs while I continued to play with Cody for a
            bit.
            Shortly after cody had walked off into the dark livingroom that wrapped with two entrances on either side
            leading from the kitchen. As I was getting ready to walk down to the basement another husky popped into
            the hallway wrap around and sat down.
            For a moment I thought it was Cody but even in the dark space I could tell it was another husky that
            had bright amber eyes and unlike Cody black fur. I called him over but as he reamined seated he
            became uninterested and then left back into the dark living room.
            I proceeded to the basement and we ended up playing games late into the night. </p>
